;;
;;  Parse a buffer for its various definition commands; place all data

;;
;;  Print   all  defined   symbols   derived  from   `wlh4-parse-defs'
;;  alphabetically  in a  buffer, with  parameters, descriptions,  and

;; TODO:
;;   - Calculate usages
;;   - Print only first line of description;
;;     rest of description is invisible but clickable

;; Main routine: Preporder Traversal of a General Tree
(defun wlh4-org-tree-traversal (org-node level)
  "Performs a `preorder' traversal of an OrgTree.

This function  traverses an OrgTree  starting from the  root node
obtained        from        the       org-element        function
`org-element-parse-buffer'.   An OrgTree  node  (`OrgNode') is  a
recursive list data structure containing either:

- type: a `type' designator identifying the type of node
- props: a plist of properties relevant to the type, and 
- contents: an indefinite number of child OrgNodes,

or

- a secondary string representing a plain-text element;

Thus, an OrgNode is one of:

-  OrgNode: (<type> (plist ...) (child OrgNode) (child OrgNode) ...)
or
-  OrgNode: #(\"string\" # # plist ...)

	    (debug)
The key to traversing an OrgTree  is knowing that the OrgNode can
be  either a  list like  `(type props  children)' or  a secondary
string.   If  it  is  a  list,  then  the  Org  Element  function
`org-element-contents' called with an  OrgNode returns a possibly
empty  list  of  child  OrgNodes, which  list  can  be  traversed
recursively  using the  preorder  tree  traversal algorithm.   If
there are  no child nodes,  or if  the OrgNode is  a `plain-text'
secondary string type, then this function does not return a list,
and no further  recursion takes place.  You must  be careful when
parsing into an OrgNode because some list functions will throw an
error when run on a secondary string.

This  procedure  walks  an   OrgTree  and  prints  some  relevant
information about  the current  OrgNode.  It  keeps track  of the
current level, prints  the current level number,  and indents the
information  by  `level'  dots  and spaces.   It  also  prints  a
`:raw-value' or `:value' or `plain-text'  string value, if one of
those is  present in the properties  (for the values) or  is that
type (for the plain-text).  It also  prints a string of keys from
the plist (without values) for reference purposes."
